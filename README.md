# Apple Picker Deluxe
By Tyler Jeffrey

## Overview
This project is an evolution of the classic "Apple Picker" prototype. It transforms a simple motor-skill game into a experience spanning across three distinct levels. Each stage introduces new mechanics designed to increase player cognitive load while also being creative ways to express the idea of difficulty.

## Mechanics
The game is divided into three difficulty modes:

* **Easy Mode (Magnetism):** Closets to the foundational experience. Apples will automatically track towards the basket once in range.
* **Medium Mode (Color Matching):** Introduces a color-matching mechanic. Players must use `1`, `2`, and `3` keys to switch their basket color to match the falling apples.
* **Hard Mode (Boss Battle):** The scene goes dark, forcing players to use a dynamic point light attached to their basket to navigate. Caught apples are converted into ammo, allowing the player to fire back at the boss using the `Spacebar`.

## Controls
| Action | Input | Mode |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Move Basket** | Mouse (Horizontal) | All |
| **Switch Color** | `1`, `2`, `3` Keys | Medium |
| **Fire Projectile** | `Spacebar` | Hard |

## Installation & Setup
1.  Clone this repository to your local machine.
2.  Open the project in **Unity 2022.3 LTS** (or newer).
3.  Ensure the `Easy`, `Medium`, and `Hard` scenes are added to the **Build Settings**.
4.  Press **Play** in the `Main_Menu` scene to begin the experience.
